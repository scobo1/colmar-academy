Codecademy Project (Unit 7 Capstone Project)

I decided to go with a blue theme with some gold accents (mainly for links). I used Adobe Color CC to find coordinating colors and play with light/dark values.
I wanted a strong serif font for headings and sans-serif for the rest of the copy, and I used Google fonts to pick those.

I didn't want any animations to distract from navigating the site, but help the user see what part she was interacting with. 

In future iterations, I might play with giving the images a slight gold overlay or finding other ways to use that color more in the site.
